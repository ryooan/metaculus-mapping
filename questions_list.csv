3.  Two reports have been published by credible sources, each quoting a separate government source from a [Five Eyes country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes) which attributes the attack to Israel. To meet the threshold, a given report must rely on a government source or document; independent investigations will not be sufficient for the purposes of this question. The reports must, together, provide at least two statements or documents that independently attribute the explosion to Israel.

If there is ambiguity about any of #1-3, a panel of three Metaculus admins will make the final determination by majority decision.

The question resolves **No** if the above does not occur before January 1, 2024. It also resolves **No** if any group other than Israel claims responsibility for the attack and that claim is validated by credible sources.","For #3, the reports may include a document obtained by the media, provided that the veracity of such a document is not subsequently disputed by the applicable government within 3 days of publication.

Metaculus holds a high standard for [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) which we will follow in assessing whether the threshold in #3 has been met:

> A ""credible source"" will be taken to be an online or in-print published story from a journalistic source, or information publicly posted on a the website of an organization by that organization making public information pertaining to that organization, or in another source where the preponderance of evidence suggests that the information is correct and that there is no significant controversy surrounding the information or its correctness.

    - The hypothetical statement ""A high-level official in the US intelligence community stated, on the condition of anonymity, that Israel's ground offensive began on October 25th"" would be sufficient for a **Yes** resolution.
    - The hypothetical statements ""Israel's much-anticipated ground offensive may begin at any moment"" or ""It appears Israel's ground offensive may have begun"" would not be sufficient for a **Yes** resolution.
* It is possible the actual start date of the ground offensive is before November 1, 2023, and that there is evidence available attesting to such a start date, but that the question resolves **No** because the evidence has not been reported definitively in one of the four listed outlets.
* A raid, which does not qualify, will generally be considered a brief incursion with a specific goal after which troops will withdraw. Metaculus will defer to the characterization of the listed sources.

De facto power will generally be considered to be held by the group which has ultimate decision-making authority over the majority of Gaza City, by area. Resolution will be determined according to reporting from [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), using available evidence such as explicit statements of de facto control or information indicating components of these criteria have been satisfied.

The sub-questions are described and defined as follows:

* **[Hamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas):** The organization which held de facto power in the Gaza Strip following its 2007 rise to power.

* **Israel:** The state of Israel, who will be considered to have de facto authority if one or more of the following is true:

    * Israel has clear military control of a majority of Gaza City by area and does not recognize any governing authority.
    * One or more individuals who are both a citizen and official representative of Israel control the governing body.

* **[Palestinian Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority) / [Fatah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah):** As the Palestinian Authority is currently controlled by Fatah, this subquestion asks if either the Palestinian Authority or Fatah will have de facto control, even if Fatah no longer controls the Palestinian Authority at the time.

* **Shared Power:** Shared power will be considered to be a governing body controlled by multiple local parties, which may include Israel. For example, de facto control by a council made up of both Israeli officials and members of the Palestinian Authority would be classified as shared power, as would a council made up of both Hamas and Fatah.

* **International Government:** International government will be considered to be a governing body controlled by one or more official representatives of a country which is not Israel or Palestine. Majority control in this case will be determined based on whether international representatives have a majority, regardless of whether they are from the same country.
    * Example: [The Coalition Provisional Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_Provisional_Authority#Reconstruction) (CPA) established in Iraq in 2003 would qualify. In this case there was an [Iraqi Governing Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Governing_Council) consisting of Iraqi leaders, however, this council was subordinate to the CFA.

* **Contested:** Contested will be defined as a situation where multiple groups are still vying for de facto control of the majority of Gaza City and it is not clear whether any group holds it. This will generally not be considered to be the case when there is a clear governing body but the governing body consists of competing parties or it is unclear who controls the governing body. Instead, this subquestion asks about the case where there is no clear governing body with de facto control of the majority of Gaza City.","* Control of the governing body will generally be defined by the existence of a clear top leadership position with substantial authority, even if there are other branches or segments of the government which have some authority. If no such role exists, such as a government led by a council or parliament, it will be determined by majority control. Note that in some cases it may not be clear whether a leadership role exists or has substantial authority, for example if there is a council chair. In that event Metaculus may make a determination as described in these criteria.
* If Israel retains clear military control over a majority of the area of Gaza City, but recognizes a government, then this will resolve according to the classification of that recognized government.
* Clear military control will generally be considered to be a consistent troop presence without widespread combat and an inability of other groups to enforce their rule in the area. Clear military control will be considered to be in place even if attacks, bombings, or other forms of unrest have occurred or are occurring, so long as the general military control of the area is not in doubt.
* De facto control will be assessed according to decision-making authority as well as ability to enforce decisions, and restrictions on the ability of a group to fully govern will not necessarily be proof of lack of de facto control. For example, as of October 31, 2023, Hamas would still be considered to have de facto control of a majority of Gaza City, despite the restrictions on water, electricity, and other imports imposed by Israel and despite the ongoing Israeli ground offensive.
* This question will resolve as the group which holds power on the date in question, for example if an election is held prior to the date and a party wins a clear majority but has not yet been inaugurated this question will not use the elected group and will instead use the incumbent group.
* The question will resolve based on publicly accessible information published on or before January 1, 2025.
* Where information is conflicting or unclear, Metaculus may make a determination to resolve the question or resolve the question as **Ambiguous**.",False,,{},{},{},
